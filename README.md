# Machine Learning Beginner Journey

This repository contains my daily and weekly machine learning learning progress. I am following a structured plan and also studying
from the book "Hands-On Machine Learning with Scikit-Learn, Keras, and TensorFlow" by O'Reilly.

The goal is to understand machine learning from the basics, build strong intuition, and implement everything through Jupyter notebooks.

## Week 1 — Core ML Foundations and Regression Models

### Day 1: Machine Learning Workflow Basics
- What is Machine Learning  
- Supervised vs Unsupervised  
- What are features and labels  
- How datasets are split into train and test  
- Why data leakage matters  
- Notebook included with full explanation

### Day 2: Linear Regression
- Understanding how linear regression works  
- What the model is trying to learn  
- How fit() and predict() work internally  
- Error metrics: MAE, MSE, RMSE  
- Creating and reading a scatter plot (actual vs predicted)  
- Step-by-step explanations inside the notebook

## Goal of This Repository
I want to build a strong understanding of ML instead of blindly writing code. Everything here is explained in simple words for future revision.

## Learning Source
Hands-On Machine Learning with Scikit-Learn, Keras, and TensorFlow  
I follow the chapters and recreate the ideas in my own notebooks.
